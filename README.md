This repository contains the official implementation of the paper: **"Prediction of thermal conductivity in multi-component magnesium alloys based on machine learning and multiscale computation"**.

## üìñ Introduction

Magnesium (Mg) alloys are gaining significant attention as next-generation lightweight, thermally conductive materials. However, their thermal conductivity tends to decrease significantly as the alloying content increases. This project introduces a novel approach that combines machine learning with multiscale computation to accurately and efficiently predict the thermal conductivity of multi-component Mg alloys.

We have systematically compiled a comprehensive database of 1,139 thermal conductivity measurements from as-cast Mg alloys. By constructing a multiscale feature set that includes elemental characteristics, thermodynamic properties, and electronic structure parameters, our model provides new insights and theoretical guidance to accelerate the development of high thermal conductivity Mg alloys.
